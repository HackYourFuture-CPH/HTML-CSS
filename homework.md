# HOMEWORK

Make your own `Developer CV / Portfolio page`!

<br/>There is a long way to go in the learning journey, but why not start with a good online presence from the get-go?

Make it as extravagant as you like and look around the internet for inspiration (f.x. [here](https://scrimba.com/articles/web-developer-portfolio-inspiration)), while the **minimum requirements** are:

- [ ] Two files: .html and .css
- [ ] Navigation bar leading to different parts of the single-page website
- [ ] Header element with your name and title
- [ ] Contact section that also includes the most important SoMe links
- [ ] Short description section
- [ ] Skill showcase section highlighting your technical skills
- [ ] Portfolio section having the [FCC Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form) as the first project.`*`
- [ ] Advanced CSS and/or animations applied to implement interesting interactive elements
- [ ] Website responsiveness so it looks good on different screen sizes and devices
- [ ] Deploy your page on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)! 

<br/>

`* ` it is not advisable to have tutorial or course projects in your portfolio, you should make sure to have unique and interesting self-driven projects. However, it is a bit too early for that. Start with the "Survey Form" and keep building and extending your project portfolio as you learn!

❗ Remember: you have to submit the homework during the week, before the weekend, so plan your workload accordingly. You can keep working on this portfolio in the future, so just focus on doing a nice initial version for now!
<br/>Check [the first homework submission](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/HTML-CSS/blob/main/first-homework-submission.md) instructions to make sure to submit the homework correctly!

**Small tip:**
- Got to [Loom.com](https://www.loom.com/) and download the app or plugin.
- It's a great way to quickly share explainer videos or explain issues you are facing.

 <br/>

Good luck! ✌️
