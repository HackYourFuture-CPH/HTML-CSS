# HTML-CSS

The students do most of the learning before the course, which is outlined in the [Pre-course](/Pre-course/readme.md) overview.

The one and only HTML-CSS session is a time to round-up the self-learning, talk about any possible questions, briefly introduce figma and, most importantly, spend a lot of time hands-on, figuring out the [exercise](/The-one-and-only-week1/readme.md).
