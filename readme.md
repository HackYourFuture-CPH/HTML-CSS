# HTML-CSS

## Introduction

In this module you will learn HTML and CSS. HTML is the language in which you define the structure of the content of your pages (e.g. headings, paragraphs, links and images). CSS is used to write down how everything should look (e.g. font sizes, colors and positions). While learning the basics of these two languages, you will also get familiar with text editors and the developer tools of your browser.

We will focus on _responsive_ web development : you will learn how to make your website adapt to the size of the screen, using the _mobile first_ approach. As well as the _accessibility_ part of it, by adpoting ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) as part of our dicipline. ARIA defines ways to make Web content and Web applications (especially those developed with Ajax and JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. Last but not least we will spend time practicing some soft skills that are important for becoming a good developer. These include: giving feedback to your colleagues, presenting and explaining your work, and finding documentation on the web.

So since this is your first module, what can you expect the next three weeks?
